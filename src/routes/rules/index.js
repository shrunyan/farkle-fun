        <p>
          Farkle is played by two or more players, with each player in
          succession having a turn at throwing the dice. Each player's turn
          results in a score, and the scores for each player accumulate to some
          winning total (usually 10,000).
        </p>

        <h2>Game Flow</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            At the beginning of each turn, the player throws all the dice at
            once.
          </li>
          <li>
            After each throw, one or more scoring dice must be set aside (see
            sections on scoring below).
          </li>
          <li>
            The player may then either end their turn and bank the score
            accumulated so far, or continue to throw the remaining dice.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the player has scored all six dice, they have "hot dice" and may
            continue their turn with a new throw of all six dice, adding to the
            score they have already accumulated. There is no limit to the number
            of "hot dice" a player may roll in one turn.
          </li>
          <li>
            If none of the dice score in any given throw, the player has
            "farkled" and all points for that turn are lost.
          </li>
          <li>
            At the end of the player's turn, the dice are handed to the next
            player in succession (usually in clockwise rotation), and they have
            their turn.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Scoring</h2>
        <p>
          You cannot count any of your points until you reach at least 500
          points in a single round. When you reach 500 points for the first
          time, you may choose to immediately end your turn to prevent losing
          the points.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sometimes a single roll will provide multiple ways to score. For
          example, a player rolling 1-2-4-5-5-5 could score one of the
          following:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>100 points for the 1</li>
          <li>150 points for the 1 and a 5</li>
          <li>500 points for the three 5's</li>
          <li>600 points for the 1 and the three 5's</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <em>
            Note that scoring combinations only count when made with a single
            throw.
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, If a player rolls a 1 and sets it aside and then rolls
          two 1â€™s on their next throw, they only score 300 points, not 1000.
        </p>

        <h2>Winning</h2>

        <p>
          Once a player has achieved a winning point total, each other player
          has one last turn to score enough points to surpass that high-score.
        </p>

        <p>The player with the high-score after final rolls is the winner.</p>
